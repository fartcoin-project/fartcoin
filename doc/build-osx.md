Mac OS X Build Instructions and Notes
====================================
This guide will show you how to build fartcoin-qt for OSX.
Tested on OSX 10.9 on 64-bit Intel processors only.

All of the commands should be executed in a Terminal application.
(cmd+space) then type terminal.

Preparation
-----------

You need to install Xcode, when you type “git” in Terminal an installation popup will appear. 
The installation for Xcode will be done in the AppStore, and needs to download at least 5 GB.

While downloading you can already install Homebrew www.brew.sh
After Xcode is installed you can install MacPorts www.macports.com
We need this in order to install library dependencies. 
Installing the dependencies using MacPorts and Brew is very straightforward.


The installation of the actual dependencies is covered in the Instructions
sections below.

Instructions: MacPorts
----------------------

    sudo port install boost openssl miniupnpc autoconf pkgconfig automake qt4-mac qrencode protobuf-cpp

Instructions: Homebrew
----------------------

    brew install autoconf automake berkeley-db boost miniupnpc openssl pkg-config protobuf qt

Instructions: Building Fartcoin-Core
----------------------

Clone the github tree to get the source code and go into the directory.
    git clone https://github.com/fartcoin/fartcoin.git 
    cd fartcoin

Build Berkeley-db-5.1.29.NC in /Users/OSX_USER/fartcoin/:

    Download berkeley-db from oracle, 
    http://download.oracle.com/berkeley-db/db-5.1.29.NC.tar.gz
    and extract it into /fartcoin/

In the fartcoin folder type:

    BITCOIN_ROOT=$(pwd)
    BDB_PREFIX=”${BITCOIN_ROOT}/db5″
    mkdir -p $BDB_PREFIX
    cd db-5.1.29.NC/
    curl -OL https://raw.github.com/narkoleptik/os-x-berkeleydb-patch/master/atomic.patch
    patch src/dbinc/atomic.h < atomic.patch
    cd build_unix/
    ../dist/configure –enable-cxx –disable-shared –with-pic –prefix=$BDB_PREFIX
    make install
    cd $BITCOIN_ROOT
    
Build fartcoin-core:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure LDFLAGS=”-L$(pwd)/db5/lib/ -L/opt/local/libexec/qt4/lib” CPPFLAGS=”-I$(pwd)/db5/include/ -I/opt/local/libexec/qt4/include” PKG_CONFIG_PATH=”/opt/local/libexec/qt4/lib/pkgconfig”
    make
    make deploy
    
It is a good idea to build and run the unit tests, too:

    make check

Creating a release build
------------------------
You can ignore this section if you are building `fartcoind` for your own use.

fartcoind/fartcoin-cli binaries are not included in the Fartcoin-Qt.app bundle.

If you are building `fartcoind` or `Fartcoin-Qt` for others, your build machine should be set up
as follows for maximum compatibility:

All dependencies should be compiled with these flags:

 -mmacosx-version-min=10.6
 -arch x86_64
 -isysroot $(xcode-select --print-path)/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk

For MacPorts, that means editing your macports.conf and setting
`macosx_deployment_target` and `build_arch`:

    macosx_deployment_target=10.6
    build_arch=x86_64

... and then uninstalling and re-installing, or simply rebuilding, all ports.

As of December 2012, the `boost` port does not obey `macosx_deployment_target`.
Download `http://gavinandresen-bitcoin.s3.amazonaws.com/boost_macports_fix.zip`
for a fix.

Once dependencies are compiled, see release-process.md for how the Fartcoin-Qt.app
bundle is packaged and signed to create the .dmg disk image that is distributed.
