## The website, Fartcoin-project.com  MemesExchange.com, the BlockExplorer and the MiningPool are all servers that are run from my home and I try to keep them 24/7 online.

## What is the ƒartcoin-project? 
The ƒartcoin-project is a project where I the developer (www.omariskandarani.com) am trying to gain knowledge about the world of cryptocurrencies by practice. The fartcoins represent in a way the stocks in the ƒartcoin-project.
Fartcoin is a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, we are taking development cues from Bitcoin, Litecoin & Dogecoin. This is the v0.9.3 release of the fartcoin-core wallet. The Fartcoin blockchain is implemented in the dogecoin wallet and got a graphical upgrade to the "Space Police" theme.  

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much ƒarticles will ever exist? 

The mining block reward is different from any other coin, since it is a reciprocal graph (y=1/x) it gradually decreases the mining reward every block. This means that instead of Bitcoin's bitshifting (halving the reward suddenly every 210k blocks) Fartcoin mining reward drops constant until block 10.000.000 where it stays at a constant 1 FART per block + miningfee.
```

BlockReward= 1 * Fartcoin / (height / 10000000)

```

## Total Fartcoins at block 10,000,000 (20 Years) = 166,953,103.60862600
```
1 Block per minute = 43800 Blocks per Month = 525600 Blocks per Year 
* Month1 = 112.6 Million Fartcoins 
* Year1  = 137.5 Million Fartcoins  
* Year10 = 160.5 Million Fartcoins 
* Year20 = 166.9 Million Fartcoins  
After block 10 million a fixed reward of 1 FART per block will continue.
```
