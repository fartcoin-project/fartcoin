## What is ƒartcoin? 
Fartcoin is a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, although it does not use SHA256 as its proof of work (POW). Taking development cues from Fartcoin, Fartcoin currently employs a simplified variant of scrypt.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much ƒarticles will ever exist? 

With every block mined the reward drops, this means that instead of halving the reward suddenly every 200k blocks Fartcoin mining reward drops constant until block 10.000.000 where it stays at a constant 1 FART per block + miningfee.
```
Calculate the exact reward per Block:

```
## Total Fartcoins at block 10,000,000 (20 Years) = 166,953,103.60862600
```
1 Block per minute = 43800 Blocks per Month = 525600 Blocks per Year 
* Month1 = 112.6 Million FartCoins 
* Month2 = 119.6 
* Month3 = 123.6
* Month4 = 126.5
* Month5 = 128.7
* Month6 = 130.6

* Year1  = 137.5 
* Year2  = 143.9
* Year3  = 147.9 
* Year4  = 151.3
* Year10 = 160.5

After block 10 million a fixed reward of 1 FART per block 
Year20 = 166,953,113 FartCoins = block 10512000 
```



### How to get ƒartcoins?
Fartcoin uses a simplified variant of the scrypt key derivation function as its proof of work with a target time of one minute per block and difficulty readjustment after 24 hours.
