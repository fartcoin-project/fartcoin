# Fartcoin Core [FART]
==========================


## What is Fartcoin? 
Fartcoin is a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, although it does not use SHA256 as its proof of work (POW). Taking development cues from Tenebrix and Litecoin, Fartcoin currently employs a simplified variant of scrypt.

## License 
Fartcoin is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING)
for more information or see http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

## Development and contributions 
Development is ongoing and the development team as well as other volunteers can freely work in their own trees and submit pull requests when features or bug fixes are ready.

#### Version strategy
Version numbers are following ```major.minor.patch``` semantics.

### How much farticles will there be?

With every block mined the reward drops, this means that instead of halving the reward suddenly every 200k blocks Fartcoin mining reward drops constant until block 10.000.000 where it stays at a constant 1 FART per block + miningfee
